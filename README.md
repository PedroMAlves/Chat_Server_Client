# Chat Server and Client
An IRC like chat server and client. Features Ascii Art and OP privileges.

Project done @ <Academia de Código_> in Fundão from 15 June to 18 June 2017.
The purpose was to create a chat server to support multiple clients using multithreading. 
Also each client can write and receive messages at the same time. Ascii Art is supported from the client side.

OP privileges are granted with a specific password set during server init (actually an argument to run the server).
OP can kick, mute or apply funny modes to specified user.

Package Client is meant to be distributed as a stand alone app used to access the server. If you need the .jar file just contact me.

Have fun. I did coding it!
